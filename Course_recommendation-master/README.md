In this Project, I have a built a udemy course recommendation system. It will recommend similar courses for which the user is searching/looking. 
In this project we used technilogies such as NLP, Machine Learning, Chart.js (for making interactive Dashboard).

Workflow: 

1) Importing the dataset.
2) Perfomed Text Processing and EDA and generate insights, then convert text to numeric values.
3) After converting text to numeric values, will calculate the cosine similarity score.
4) Then will sort the values which have similar similarity score and recommend the course.
5) Integrate the Recommendation System with FLASK Framework.
